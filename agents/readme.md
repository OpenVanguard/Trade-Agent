# Agents Stock Trading Agent

This project involves building a stock trading agent that processes and learns from stock market data. The goal of this agent is to make informed trading decisions that maximize profitability or optimize specific financial metrics.

## Objectives

The agent is designed with the following objectives:

1. **Predict Future Stock Prices or Returns**:  
   The agent leverages historical data to predict future price movements, aiming to anticipate trends and potential buy/sell opportunities. Accurate price predictions provide a foundation for generating effective trading signals.

2. **Generate Buy/Sell Signals**:  
   Based on predicted prices, the agent creates buy/sell signals that guide trading actions. These signals help automate trading decisions by indicating when the agent should enter or exit positions.

3. **Optimize Trading Strategy**:
   - **Maximize Profit**: The agent’s primary goal is to maximize profit over a defined period.
   - **Sharpe Ratio Optimization**: By balancing risk and return, the agent aims to increase the Sharpe ratio, which is a common metric for risk-adjusted returns.
   - **Reduced Volatility**: The agent considers volatility in the trading strategy, aiming to create a steady performance by minimizing exposure to high-risk trades.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Integrates with APIs or databases (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage) to retrieve real-time and historical stock market data.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Cleans and processes raw data, generating technical indicators and other features to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Uses machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Transformers, Reinforcement Learning) to make data-driven predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Tracks the performance of trading decisions using metrics like profit, Sharpe ratio, and volatility.
- **Backtesting**: Tests the agent’s trading strategies on historical data to evaluate potential effectiveness and refine the model.
- **Real-time Trading Simulation**: Simulates a live trading environment to monitor and adapt the agent’s decisions in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Data libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`
- API libraries: `yfinance`, `requests`
- Machine learning libraries: `gym`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`
- Optional backtesting tools: `backtrader`, `quantlib`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-trading-agent.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Run the data collection script to retrieve and preprocess data.
2. **Train the Model**: Use the training script to train the agent on historical stock data.
3. **Backtest**: Run the backtesting script to simulate the agent’s performance on historical data.
4. **Deploy**: Deploy the agent in a live or simulated trading environment.

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Data Sources**: Incorporate sentiment data, economic indicators, and news.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implement more sophisticated models, including ensemble methods.
- **Enhanced Risk Management**: Integrate stop-loss strategies and other risk controls.
