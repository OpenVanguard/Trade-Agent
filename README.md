# Trade Agent

## Overview

**Trade Agent** is a repository of AI agent configurations designed for scalable deployment across multiple stocks. Developed by the **Open Agents Organization**, these configurations leverage temporal stock data to optimize predictive accuracy for each stock. Built with scalability in mind, the repository allows for deploying and managing thousands of agent configurations on cloud platforms and container orchestration systems like AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Agent Pool**: Each stock is analyzed by multiple agent configurations, enabling high predictive accuracy through top-performing agents. For example, 10 agents may be trained on data for Apple, and only the best are retained.

- **Massive Deployment Capability**: Trade Agent configurations are built to run at scale, with thousands of agents deployed in parallel across stocks to optimize prediction.

- **Adaptive and Profitable Prediction**: Agents automatically adapt to new data, ensuring predictions are continually refined to provide maximum potential accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8** or higher
- Packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- **Docker**, **AWS CLI**, and **kubectl** installed for deployment

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Prepare Stock Data**: Gather historical stock data and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. **Train Agent Configurations**:
   Run the training script to initiate training for each stock. Each agent configuration will be evaluated for prediction quality.
   
   ```bash
   python src/train.py --stock-symbol AAPL --agent-count 10
   ```

3. **Evaluate Configurations**:
   Use the evaluation script to rank agents and select only the top configurations for deployment.
   
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py --stock-symbol AAPL
   ```

4. **Deploy at Scale**:
   Choose from deployment options below (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker) to deploy agents at scale.

## Deployment Guide

### 1. Docker Deployment

To containerize and deploy Trade Agent configurations locally or in a cloud environment:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t trade-agent:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
   ```

2. **Run a Docker Container**:
   Run the container with a specific stock agent configuration.
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name trade_agent -e STOCK_SYMBOL=AAPL trade-agent:latest
   ```

3. **Scale with Docker Compose**:
   If running multiple agents simultaneously, use `docker-compose.yml` for multi-container deployment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment

For large-scale, distributed deployment, Trade Agent can be orchestrated using Kubernetes:

1. **Deploying on Kubernetes**:
   Use the provided Kubernetes manifests to deploy agents as pods.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
   ```

2. **Scaling Pods**:
   To run multiple agents for the same or different stocks, configure `replicas` in the `deployment.yaml` or scale the deployment on the fly:
   
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment trade-agent --replicas=10
   ```

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   Use `kubectl logs` to view real-time logs of individual agent pods.
   
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
   ```

### 3. AWS Deployment

To deploy agents on AWS infrastructure, the repository includes CloudFormation templates and sample scripts:

1. **Setting up an EC2 Instance**:
   Use the AWS CLI or console to set up an EC2 instance with Docker and Docker Compose pre-installed.

2. **Using ECS for Container Deployment**:
   - **Build and Push to ECR**: First, create an Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository and push the Docker image:
     ```bash
     aws ecr create-repository --repository-name trade-agent
     docker tag trade-agent:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/trade-agent:latest
     docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/trade-agent:latest
     ```

   - **Deploy to ECS**: Use ECS to run and manage Docker containers at scale. Use `aws/ecs-task-definition.json` to define task parameters.
   
     ```bash
     aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://aws/ecs-task-definition.json
     aws ecs run-task --cluster <cluster-name> --task-definition trade-agent
     ```

3. **Auto-Scaling with AWS Lambda and CloudWatch**:
   Set up auto-scaling policies on ECS based on CPU/memory metrics, using CloudWatch alarms and Lambda functions to dynamically scale up or down based on load.

## Emphasis on Scale and Adaptability

Trade Agent is designed for large-scale deployment, supporting thousands of agent configurations operating in parallel across multiple stocks. By deploying on Docker, Kubernetes, or AWS, the repository provides flexible deployment options for small-scale testing to full production environments, enabling rapid identification of optimal agents for stock prediction.
