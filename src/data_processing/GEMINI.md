# GEMINI Instructions: data_processing/

This folder contains scripts for data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and technical indicators.

## Guidelines
- Place all data ingestion, transformation, and indicator scripts here.
- Example modules: `data_processor.py`, `download_data.py`, `technical_indicators.py`.
- Ensure functions are reusable and well-documented.
- Add tests for new data processing logic in `src/tests/`.
