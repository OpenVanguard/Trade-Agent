# GEMINI Instructions: models/

This folder contains model definitions, training, validation, and related utilities.

## Guidelines
- Place all model architecture, training, and validation scripts here.
- Example modules: `dqn_model.py`, `training.py`, `validation.py`, `train_all.py`.
- Keep model code modular and configurable.
- Document hyperparameters and training routines.
- Add tests for model logic in `src/tests/`.
